		  <h3>Knitting</h3>
		  <img class="left" src="img/full.JPG" alt="Photo of completed blanket">
		  <p>A week before the semester started, I got myself back into knitting. I have knit things before, such as a scarf the year before, but I stopped after I finished it. This time, I hope to continue knitting.</p>
		  <p>I recently finished a 5 foot by 5 foot (roughly) throw blanket. It is by far the largest knitting project I&apos;ve ever done. It took me over a month of work, but I am satisfied with the result. It consists mainly of a stockinette stitch, broken up by a basic lace pattern forming columns of diamonds down the length of the blanket. The yarn I used was pretty cheap. It does not feel nearly as soft as other yarns do. However, it looks alright and pretty colorful. It transitions between a very light (nearly white) blue, blue-green, sky blue, and a dark blue-green color repeatedly. The blanket is rather visually detailed, with the colors changing suddenly on every square inch, and the added texture of the lace pattern.</p>
		  <img class="right" src="img/detail.JPG" alt="Close-up photo of blanket, showing off the lace pattern">
		  <p>For this project, I had to learn how to read knitting instructions (which are full of acronyms that I did not understand a month ago). I had to learn how to knit two stitches together. Knitting two stitches together (which is a decrease), followed immediately after by a yarn over (which is an increase), creates the base of the lace pattern. Alternating spans of knit stitches and this lace stitch on the right side, and rows of purl stitches on the wrong side, gives it a really awesome look. Around the edges, it is surrounded by a garter stitch, which is just knitting on both the right and the wrong side of the blanket.</p>
		  <p>In the future, I hope to learn more patterns and knit more projects. I&apos;m thinking about knitting a basic cap, which I might wear when the weather gets colder. I will use some light grey yarn I picked up that was much softer than the stuff I used for the blanket. A pattern I want to learn is the honeycomb brioche stitch. Not only do I love the name, but it also looks really awesome and it has some nice thickness to it. I think it would work well as a scarf. I&apos;ve tried to do it before, but for some reason it wasn't looking quite right. I also want to learn how to work with multiple colors. I think I understand how it would work in theory, with just swapping between which yarn strand is used for a stitch and leaving the other strand hanging on the wrong side of the item until it is needed again, but I am not fully sure, and I need to do more research into how it works.</p>

		  <h3>Computers</h3>
		  <p>I really like computers. A lot. I especially love older computers. The older, the cooler. The oldest computer I have is a laptop from the mid-90&apos;s. The early 90&apos;s are probably my favorite era in computers. I don't know much about anything older, but from what I&apos;ve heard, it sounds extremely fascinating.</p>

				<p>I'm hoping to get even more old tech in the future. Something I have my eye on is the Fujitsu LifeBook T4410. I got to disassemble one for one of my classes at Illinois Tech, and it amazed me just how feature-packed it was. A fingerprint reader, a screen that can rotate <em>BACKWARDS</em> (I don&apos;t mean flip backwards like today&apos;s laptops do, I mean it was on a hinge that in addition to letting it move in the open/close direction, it could also <em>SPIN</em> so that you could cover the keyboard and touchpad with the back side of the screen!), a touchscreen, numerous ports; it was seriously a sight to behold. I <em>really</em> want to get my hands on one. I chose not to reassemble the one I got to disassemble, since I did not think I would be able to reassemble it, and I am pretty sure I permanently damaged something inside it.</p>

				<img class="right" src="img/G4.jpg" alt="A photo of an Apple iMac G4">
				<p>I have an iMac G4 I got for free that was running Mac OS 10.4. It has a PowerPC processor in it. It was really interesting to disassemble, since the design is unlike any other computer I&apos;ve seen, ever. The bottom is easy to unscrew, which hides a SODIMM slot, as well as a slot for what I believe was the Apple AirPort Extreme card (for Wi-Fi). However, after disassembling it even further and fully removing the bottom, I gained access to the motherboard. There was another RAM slot there, inaccessible to most users. It was for a full-size DIMM. The power supply was further up inside the base, basically at the top. I made sure not to touch any of it, since it seemed to be rather exposed. The DVD drive and hard drive both used PATA interfaces, and they were stacked on top of one another. They were pretty annoying to get out. The reason I am really interested in older Apple computers that had a PowerPC processor is that I really want to run Mac OS 9 or earlier. I&apos;ve never gotten to use it, and I am really curious as to what it is like. So far, I&apos;ve struggled to even reinstall Mac OS 10.4 from any disk images I could find online. It seemingly doesn&apos;t want to boot from most optical disks. Honestly, I think I broke the already functional installation of Mac OS on the machine. Perhaps I need to look for someone selling the install disks for one of these machines.</p>

		  <p>I also have an old Apple iBook G4. It also has a PowerPC processor, but from what I read online, it seems to be completely incapable of running Mac OS 9. What I find interesting about the device is that it has both a removable battery and a removable keyboard hiding some slots for hardware! I was genuinely so surprised that Apple allowed for users to remove that stuff in their older devices!</p>
		  <p>I have a few more old laptops. My favorite is an incredibly thick laptop (genuinely must be around 2 inches think). I think it came with Windows Me installed. Windows Me was probably the worst version of Windows ever released. That is exactly why I want to have a working Windows Me machine. I am consistently impressed with how modular older laptops were. Just about everything was easily accessible.</p>
		  <p>I have a laptop from around 2005 that I got from the school I work at. It was used by one of the IT staff back when I was a student. After he left, he left his laptop with the school. It sat unused and was going to be recycled, so I took it home with me. I thought it would be a little funny to install Gentoo Linux on it. I did manage to install it and get it working, but it involved a lot of compiling software. And I mean a <em>lot</em>. I had it compiling for around 24 hours straight. On a modern laptop, I would be afraid to spend so long compiling software on it, out of fear that it would overheat. However, the cooling was so good in this laptop, I don&apos;t think it got very hot, even after 24 hours.</p>
